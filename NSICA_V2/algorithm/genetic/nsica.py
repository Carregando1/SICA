!!! IMPORTANT !!!
!!! CHANGES IN SRT SYNTAX !!!
In this combinatoric generalization of SICA to n states (no direct restrictions), the SRT indexing routine has a significant 
difference to that of previous SICAProject versions, such as SICA_V2 or CAX_2S. The SRT indexing routine
implemented in this version is as follows:
- For a single cell *C*, let the state of *C* be C_state, and let the number of neighbors of *C* in each state 
[1, 2, ..., max_state] (note that this tuple excludes the state 0; this is intentional) be a tuple in the form 
(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Such a tuple will be notated as a "neighbor tuple". Note that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n 
must be equal to or less than 8 in order to satisfy the Moore neighborhood condition; 
the difference between 8 and this sum is equal to the number of neighbors in the state 0.
- We order all possible tuples satisfying a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n ≤ 8 as follows:
  * All tuples are first sorted in descending value of a_1, so the tuple (8, 0, ..., 0) is first in the list
  (index 0);
  * All tuple groups with a_1 constant are then sorted in descending value of a_2;
  * All tuple groups with both a_1 and a_2 constant are then sorted in descending value of a_3, and so on.
  * Let the length of this list be order_len.
- Each SRT raw rule (C_state, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) -> final_state is added to the SRT array as follows:
  * The index of the rule within the array is (C_state * order_len + the corresponding index of the neighbor 
  tuple (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n));
  * The value of the index is final_state.
- The neighbor tuple of the cell *C* is then matched to its corresponding index in the SRT to determine its 
final state.
For example, the ordering of the tuples with (n = max_state = 2, number of states = 3) is:
[(8,0), (7,1), (7,0), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (3,5),
(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4),
(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0)], with length 45.
A sample SRT ruleset with number of states = 3 (guaranteed to be of length 3 * 45 = 135) could start with:
[1,2,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,2,2,2,1,2,0,1,2,0, ...]
The final state of a sample cell with cell state 0 and neighbor tuple (a_1, a_2) = (4,2) would be determined by the
value of the SRT at index (0 * 45) + 12 (12 is the index of the tuple (4,2)). This value is 1.
Thus, the final state of this cell would be 1.
