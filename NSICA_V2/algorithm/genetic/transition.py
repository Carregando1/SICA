	transition.py: Takes in an IC and SRT and outputs the state after {steps} steps of simulation of an NSICA. Merged with state.py.
	Args:
	ic: a 2D square array with only 0s and 1s.
	srt: a 4D array with dims (time, width, height, rules), with rules equal to states * ((7 + states)C8), where xCy = x!/(y! * (x-y)!), ! denoting factorial.
	steps: The number of steps the NSICA is run. Must be less than srt.shape[0].
	states: The number of states of the NSICA.
	generated: Result of the NSICA progression, if already computed. This is a result of merging state.py into transition.py.
